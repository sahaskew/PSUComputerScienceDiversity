<h1>Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Diversity in PSU Computer Science Department</h2>
</br>
<h2>TEAM MEMBERS:</h2> 
<p>Danielle Beyer
Sarah Haskew
Special Guest: Alyssa Tamayo</p>

<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2>
<p>To evaluate, with an equity lens, the experience of diverse groups of students within the PSU Computer Science Department.</p>

<h2>APPROACH: </h2>
<p>The team will analyze statistics about student retention and graduation rates within the CS Department, as compared to national CS statistics. Upon approval from the IRB, the team will solicit former and current CS students to participate in surveys about their experiences within the department. Those interviews will be reviewed in order to identify overall themes. 

Utilizing the results of the analyzed data and the trends identified in the student interviews, we will create an overall report of our findings. </p>

<h2>TEAM STRUCTURE:</h2>
<p>Danielle will be responsible for completion and submission of the IRB documentation, with Ellie Harmon’s support. 
If data is available, Alyssa will implement a database with the support of both Danielle and Sarah. 
All team members will recruit for interviews and conduct interviews. 
Interview analysis and summary will be led by Sarah with the support of all team members. </p>
